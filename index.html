        <h1>EXPLORE THE WORLD OF SKYLINE</h1>
        <p>
          The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Tourismo-Racing while the GT-B
          stands for Gran Tourismo-Berlinetta. The Japanese chose to use Italian
          naming conventions when naming the car - as most cars that were made
          in Japan at that time used Western abbreviations - to further enhance
          sales

        <h2>THE CAR IN YOUR DREAMS</h2>
        <p>
          The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showcasing
          many advanced technologies

        <p>
          The GT-R's history of racetrack dominance began with its 50 victories
          scored from 1968 to 1972, including 49 consecutive wins in the
          Japanese race circuit. Nissan pulled out of racing shortly after the
          introduction of the KPGC110 due to the 1973 oil crisis

          The interior of the car was very basic and featured racing bucket
          seats and a three-spoke steering wheel along with wood inserts. The
          pedals were finished in aluminium

          The Skyline GT-R Nismo, identified by the model code suffix
          "RA",include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of
          the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a
          bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear
          spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce
